# Visual Basic Language Design Meeting - 2017.08.30

### Agenda
* Nullable reference type

## Nullable reference types
Not ready yet. Revisit after the C# Prototype is released and we have more user feedback and concrete design decisions. Also, the damnit operator `!` conflicts with both VBs dictionary-access operator `dict!key` and the type character for single-precision floating-point numbers `Dim radius!` so we'll have to resolve that.
