We've been reconsidering some details about the "nameof" operator. This was prompted by a few questions:

* _Why can't I write "nameof(this.p)"? My convention is to always put 'this' in front of my fields and properties._
* _Why does the IDE throw an exception when I rename symbols that appear in nameof expressions? Why is it so hard to write analyzers that work correctly in the face of nameof?_

A revised spec is below. The chief difference from the original spec ([part1](https://roslyn.codeplex.com/discussions/552376) and [part2](https://roslyn.codeplex.com/discussions/552377)) is that now the argument of nameof(.) is just an expression, like any other expression in the language (in CTP4 it had been an unusual hybrid similar in some ways to the argument of typeof). The common cases of nameof will still be written the same as what's in CTP4, but some edge cases will be different.

There's one chief open design question remaining, detailed below.

Please let us know what you think!


# nameof operator: revised spec

The nameof(.) operator takes one expression argument (note that in C#, types are expressions). There are two principles: in essence, (1) the expression must "have a name", and (2) it must resolve to one single symbol.

## Bread and butter cases
```cs
// Validate parameters 
void f(string s) {
    if (s == null) throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(s));
}
```

```cs
// MVC Action links
<%= Html.ActionLink("Sign up",
             nameof(UserController),
             nameof(default(UserController).SignUp()))
%>
```

```cs
// INotifyPropertyChanged
int p {
    get { return this._p; }
    set { this._p = value; PropertyChanged(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(nameof(this.p)); }
}
```

```cs
// XAML dependency property
public static DependencyProperty AgeProperty = DependencyProperty.Register(nameof(default(C).Age), typeof(int), typeof(C));
```

```cs
// Logging
void f(int i) {
    Log(nameof(f(i)), "method entry");
}
```

```cs
// Attributes
[DebuggerDisplay("={" + nameof(default(C).getString()) + "()}")]
class C {
    string getString() { ... }
}
```

_I'm sorry. Markdown keeps turning my plus symbols into ampersand hash 43. I don't know how to stop it._

I call out the last two cases. If we decided to break principle (2), then we could allow method-groups, and hence omit the argument lists for these two cases. We could reasonably choose either to keep principle (2) or to break it, and there are pros and cons to both sides. More details in the post below.

# Implementation
```cs
class NameOfExpressionSyntax : ExpressionSyntax { readonly ExpressionSyntax argument; }
```
For source code that compiles without errors, semanticModel.GetSymbolInfo(argument) will return a single symbol. For erroneous code it might also return 0 or many candidates.

(Under the alternative option, where principle (2) is violated, then we would make GetSymbolInfo return no single preferred symbol, and instead always return a candidate list. Analyzers would now have to deal with this case for successful user code as well as for erroneous user code.)

# C# Syntax
```
expression: … | nameof-expression

nameof-expression:
    nameof ( nameof-expression-argument )

nameof-expression-argument:
    simple-name                  x
    member-access                e.x, e.x<int>, e?.x,
                                 int.TryParse, a::b.c
    invocation-expression        e(args)
    base-access-named            base.x
```

It is helpful to list what is not allowed as the nameof argument. In general, nameof accepts expressions that have names (including type expressions that have names). All other arguments produce compile-time error "This expression does not have a name". Here are the expressions that are not allowed:
```
    assignment                   x += 15
    query-expression             from y in z select y
    lambda-expression            () => e
    conditional-expression       a ? b : c
    null-coalescing-expression   a?? b
    binary-expression            ||, &&, |, ^, &, ==, !=,
                                 <, >, <=, >=, is, as, <<,
                                 >>, +, -, *, /, %
    prefix-expression            +, -, !, ~, ++, --,
                                 (cast)e, *, &
    postfix-expression           ++, --
    array-creation-expression    new C[…]
    object-creation-expression   new C(…)
    delegate-creation-expression new Action(…)
    anonymous-object-creation-expression new {…}
    typeof-expression            typeof(int)
    checked-expression           checked(…)
    unchecked-expression         unchecked(…)
    default-value-expression     default(…)
    anonymous-method-expression  delegate {…}
    pointer-member-access        e->x
    sizeof-expression            sizeof(int)
    literal                      "hello", 15
    parenthesized-expression     (x)
    element-access               e[i]
    this-access                  this
    base-access-indexed          base[i]
    await-expression             await e
    nameof-expression            nameof(e)
    vb-dictionary-lookup         e!foo 
```

Note that there are some types which are not counted as expressions by the C# grammar. These are not allowed as nameof arguments (since the nameof syntax only allows expressions for its argument). It is a pleasant coincidence that none of these types even have names, so they wouldn't be useful as a nameof argument anyway. Even keywords like "int" and "bool" are not names; they are keywords. There's no need to spell out that the following things are not valid expressions, since that's already said by the language syntax, but I'm going to spell it out anyway. 
```
    predefined-type              int, bool, float, object,
                                 dynamic, string, void
    nullable-type                Customer?
    array-type                   Customer[,]
    pointer-type                 Buffer*, void* 
```           

# Semantics

The nameof expression is a constant. In all cases, nameof(…) is evaluated at compile-time to produce a string. Its argument is not evaluated at runtime, and is considered unreachable code (however it does not emit an "unreachable code" warning).

_Name lookup._ The same rules of "simple name lookup" and "member access" apply to nameof arguments as they do to the rest of the language.

_Accessibility._ The same rules of accessibility apply to nameof arguments as they do to all other expressions.

_Error in binding._ The same rules of binding apply to nameof as to all other expressions. If binding to the argument/type would result in an error, e.g. to obsolete methods, then that is still an error for purposes of nameof.

_Definite assignment._ The same rules of definite assignment apply to nameof arguments as they do to all other unreachable expressions.

_VB invocation / indexing._ In VB, e(…) might be either an method invocation, a delegate invocation, an array indexing, a property access, a default property access, or an invocation of a parameterless function "e" followed by indexing. Which one of these it is, is determined by symbol resolution. After symbol resolution, as with C#, only method invocations are allowed as nameof arguments.

_Result of the nameof operator._ This depends on the form of the nameof argument…

__nameof(simple-name)__, of the form I<A1…AK>
__nameof(member-access)__, of the form E.I<A1…AK>
__nameof(base-access-named)__, of the form base.I<A1…AK>

These cases are all resolved using the rules for simple name lookup $7.6.2 or member access $7.6.4. If they succeed in binding, they must bind to one of:

* A method-group. This produces an error "To specify the name of a method, you must provide its arguments".
* A variable, value, parameter, constant, enumeration-member, property-access, field, event, type-parameter, namespace or type. In this case the result of the nameof operator is simply "I", which is generally the name of the symbol that the argument bound to. There are some caveats…

If "I" identified an alias e.g. "using I = X.Y.Z; nameof(I)", then the result of nameof is still "I", even though the expression bound to the type X.Y.Z.

Also "I" undergoes the standard identifier transformations prior to being returned from nameof. In C# these are detailed in $2.4.2 of the C# spec: first any leading @ is removed, then Unicode escape sequences are transformed, and then any formatting-characters are removed. This of course still happens at compile-time. In VB, any surrounding [] is removed.

Also in VB the result has the capitalization that was used in the argument. This might be different from the capitalization of the symbol that the argument bound to.


__nameof(invocation-expression)__, of the form F(args)

The invocation expression must be either a method-invocation because F was a method-group, or a delegate-invocation because F was a value of delegate type.

* If a method-invocation, then F must have had the form E.I<A1…AK> or I<A1…AK> or base.I<A1…AK> from other rules in the language, and must have bound to a method-group. F(args) must bind to a unique method by the normal rules of overload resolution. The result of the nameof operator is simply I, subject to the same transformations as above.

* If a delegate-invocation, it is a compile-time error "This expression does not have a name."

# Chief Open Design Question

Principle (2) says the nameof argument must resolve to one single symbol. Is this a principle worth sticking to? It could go either way. Let's examine the issues, starting with some concrete examples...

```cs
// Logging
void f(int i) {
    Log(nameof(f(i)), "method entry");
}
```

```cs
// Attributes
[DebuggerDisplay("={" + nameof(default(C).getString()) + "()}")]
class C {
    string getString() { ... }
}
```

If we decided to break principle (2), then we could allow method-groups, and hence omit the argument lists for these two examples. We could reasonably choose either to keep principle (2) or to break it, and there are pros and cons to both sides.

## Comparison: code
```cs
void M(int i) {
}
void M(string s) { 
    var x = nameof(M);    // error with principle (2); okay without it
    var x = nameof(M(s)); // okay
    var x = nameof(M(s)); // okay
}
```

## Comparison: logging code
```cs
// Logging
void f(int i) {
    Log(nameof(f(i)), "method entry"); // with principle (2) you have to supply arguments
    Log(nameof(f), "method entry"); // without it, you can omit arguments
}
```

## Comparison: attributes
```cs
// Attributes
[DebuggerDisplay(nameof(default(C).getString())] // with principle (2) you supply parentheses
[DebuggerDisplay(nameof(default(C).getString)] // without it, you can omit them
class C {
    string getString() { ... }
}
```

## Comparison: IDE behavior

With principle (2), IDE refactoring behavior will be understandable, e.g. if you rename M then you can anticipate how it will be renamed inside nameof arguments. It's easy to understand+predict what HighlightAllReferences and GoToDef and FindAllReferences will do.

Without principle (2), IDE refactoring becomes less predictable. What will happen if you rename-refactor the second "M" in _Comparison:Code_? Would it rename the first one as well, and also the nameof argument? It's also not clear how CodeLens and other tools would count nameof(M). Would it count it as a reference to all overloads of M? There are probably similar issues all over the IDE.

## Comparison: typing burden

With principle (2), you always need to specify which overload of M you're referring to, even though they have the same name. (In mitigation, it's often quite easy to specify which overload. As in the logging case, you typically do it within the method you wish to name, and so you typically have parameters to hand).

## Comparison: conceptual burden

Without principle (2), nameof will be the _only_ part of the language where "method-group" is a valid expression. Everywhere else it must be resolved to a single method.

## Comparison: analyzer burden

With principle (2), it will be easier to write analyzers. They won't blow up in untested corner cases involving nameof.
