# Better support for immutable data, with pattern-matching

## Request

Please make it easier for me to declare immutable data-types, and make it easier to code over them via pattern-matching. Easier immutable datatypes will make my code have fewer defects, and pattern-matching over immutable data (like in F#, Scala and other functional languages) will allow clean readable maintanable coding idioms.

For instance, I have a method and want to return 2-3 return values. Here's the ugly code I write now:
``` cs
// Ugly 1: use out params (but doesn't work with async)
void Lookup(out string name, out int x, out int y) {...}
...
Lookup(out name, out x, out y); Console.WriteLine(name);


// Ugly 2: use a tuple (but my consumer has a hard time knowing which element is what)
Tuple<string,int,int> Lookup() {...}
...
var r = Lookup(); Console.WriteLine(r.Item1);


// Ugly 3: declare a custom datatype
class LookupResult(string name, int x, int y)
{
   public string Name {get;} = name;
   public int X {get;} = x;
   public int Y {get;} = y;
}
LookupResult Lookup() {...}
...
var r = Lookup(); Console.WriteLine(r.Name);
```

What I'd like is to write all this much more simply:
``` cs
class LookupResult(string name, int x, int y);
LookupResult Lookup() {...}

var r = Lookup(); Console.WriteLine(r?.name);
```

Even better, I'd like to deconstruct the returned value using pattern-matching:
``` cs
if (Lookup() matches LookupResult(var name, var x, var y)) { ... }
```


## Background

We have been guided in our thoughts by the paper "Matching Objects with Patterns" by Emir, Odersky and Williams. There's a link to it on this Scala webpage: http://www.scala-lang.org/old/node/112

The Roslyn compiler currently has "primary constructors" in C#, and a form of "typecase" in VB:

``` cs
class C(int x, int y)
{
    public int X { get; set; } = x;
    public int Y { get; set; } = y;
}
```
``` vb
Function GetArea(shape As Shape) As Double
    Select Case shape
        Case r As Rect : Return r.X * r.Y
        Case c As Circle : Return Math.PI * c.Radius * c.Radius
    End Select
End Function

' Once we add Out expressions to VB, you can get more pattern-matchey
Function Eval(expr As Expr) As Integer
    Select Case expr
        Case e As PlusExpr When e.Matches(0, Out rhs)
            Return Eval(rhs)
        Case e As PlusExpr When e.Matches(Out rhs, 0)
            Return Eval(rhs)
        Case e As PlusExpr When e.Matches(Out lhs, Out rhs)
            Return Eval(lhs) + Eval(rhs)
        Case e As IntExpr
            Return e.Val
    End Select
End Function
```

**Question: how will the two features work together?** Will there be a "sweet spot" where their designs mesh together well, and mesh with additional features in future versions of the languages, to produce a nice pattern-matching design? Something as nice as what F# or Scala have?

**Urgent question: do we need to make changes to the CURRENT design of primary constructors and Select Case** so that we don't block off a future world of pattern-matching?


## PROPOSAL: Records, and Plain Old CLR Objects

Here is a coherent set of proposals that combine construction and deconstruction into one neat easily-written proposal, to support the scenario in the "Request".


Imagine something called a *"Record"*, a type with an ordered list of named data members. Not saying there should be a new kind of type called a "record type" alongside classes and structs... indeed it might be best not to have a new kind of type, since we might want record-like classes and structs.

**PROPOSAL 1:** a record can be defined using primary-constructor syntax, and it is syntactic sugar for an expanded form as follows...
``` cs
class Point(int X, int Y);

==>

class Point(int X, int Y)
{
   public int X { get; } = X;
   public int Y { get; } = Y;
}
```

The rule is: "When you write a record, it automatically generates properties for the *PRIMARY PROPERTIES*, unless you have provided those properties yourself". The term "Primary Properties" refers to the parameters in the primary-constructor syntax. Thus, if you didn't want it to auto-generate a property, you'd have to provide your own version of that property, as in the example below. (There's no way to say that you *don't* want the property with this syntax: if you don't want the property, then don't use the feature at all).
```cs
class Point(int X, int Y) { public int X => 15; }

==>

class Point(int X, int Y)
{
   public int X => 15;
   public int Y {get; set;} = Y;
}
```

**PROPOSAL 2:** Just as we've seen the compiler auto-generate properties if you failed to provide them yourself, it will also auto-generate a default implementation of Equals and GetHashCode if you fail to provide them yourself. This default implementation will do element-wise calls to Equals and GetHashCode on the primary properties.

(By default, Proposal 1 uses immutable properties, and so Equals/GetHashCode will terminate. It's bad practice to for GetHashCode to calculate based on mutable properties.)


**PROPOSAL 3:** In addition to auto-generated properties, Equals, GetHashCode, we also auto-generate a MAtch operator (unless one is provided by the user)...

``` cs
class Point(int X, int Y)
{
  public int X {get;} = X;
  public int Y {get;} = Y;
  public static bool operator Matches(Point self, out int X, out int Y) {X=self.X; Y=self.Y; return true;}
}
```

In addition to this, we introduce a new *MATCH* operator into the language:

``` cs
<expr> matches T(args)
```
Operational semantics:

1. Evaluate "var tmp1 = <expr>"
2. Look in type "T" for an overload of "Matches" whose 2nd...last parameters match the arguments
3. Evaluate "var tmp2 = tmp1 As TFirst" where TFirst is the type of the first parameter of that overload
4. If this is null, then the match operator returns false
5. Otherwise, the result invoke the Match operator, passing it (tmp2, args) as arguments.

You'd use the match operator like this:
``` cs
if (f() matches T(var name, var x, var y)) { ... }
```
Note that this would have different rules from the way out vars are currently conceived. These out be definitely assigned only if the "e matches T(args)" returns true. Incidentally, note that the T's Match operator is not necessarily invoked... e.g. if f() returns null, then it won't be called!



**PROPOSAL 4:** You could also treat the typename as a method, e.g.
``` cs
var p = Point(2,3);
==>
var p = new Point(2,3);
```
All this does is remove the need for the word "new" for these record types. It might seem pointless, but it unifies the way you write construction and deconstruction...
``` cs
var p = Point(2,3);
if (p matches Point(out x, out y)) { ... }
```


## Discussion

There were questions raised, heated discussions, and no agreed-upon answers.


Q. If we go with primary constructors as they're currently envisaged (where the primary parameters *don't* define fields, and instead only exist at construction-time), then will we still be able to support this vision of pattern-matching?

A. Not directly. But we could support this vision through a new modifier "record", e.g. `record class Point(int x, int y)`



Q. What is the difference between putting all this "record" stuff (auto-generated properties, Equals, GetHashCode, Match operator) into the existing primary constructor syntax, vs putting them in via a new modifier "record" ?

A1. It's a language-cleanliness problem. It would feel goofy for the primary constructor syntax to mean such different things depending on whether the "record" modifier is present.

A2. Case is different. The convention in C# will be to use lower-case for primary constructor parameters, since users will write out the properties manually and use upper-case for that. But with records, the convention will probably be to use uper-case for the primary properties.



Q. It feels wrong for primary-constructors to be so closely tied to immutable data and pattern-matching. Primary constructors have many other uses even when you don't want the rest, e.g. for coding visitor-patterns. Can we add all the features (primary constructors, Matches, Equals/GetHashCode, auto-generated properties) individually and orthogonally over time? And then use "concise declaration" (via whatever syntax) as the thread that ties everything together and delivers the smooth end-to-end use-case?

A. Maybe our goal should be to make a concise story for the desired use-case, rather than to add orthogonal features?


Q. Is it important that users can declare Match operators today, right from the first version of primary constructors? (granted, this would be pretty much useless on its own: the Match operator only becomes useful in conjunction with all the other features).



Q. How would these "record types" work with serialization? People commonly use Plain Old CLR Objects (POCO) when they want DataContract serialization. But there's no clear way with this proposal to attribute the individual properties.



Q. What's needed to ship in the first version of primary-constructors so as to allow this kind of evolution over time? Are there any conflicts with the current proposals (of primary-constructors and SelectCase) that would prevent such evolution?

A. Neal and Mads will meet, discuss this question, and take it to C# LDM next week.
